Write a SQL statement for each of the following. 

1. Get 10 cities in descending alphabetical order.
SELECT *
FROM city
ORDER BY city DESC
LIMIT 10;

2. Get all films with "airplane" in the title.
SELECT *
FROM film
WHERE title LIKE '%airplane%';

3. Get the highest payment amount.
SELECT MAX(amount)
FROM payment;

4. Get the number of records in the customer table for store id #1.
SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE store_id = 1;

5. Get all payment records for customer with email address "NANCY.THOMAS@sakilacustomer.org"
SELECT *
FROM payment as p
INNER JOIN customer as c
ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE c.email = 'NANCY.THOMAS@sakilacustomer.org';

6. Use a View to get the film info for actor Bob Fawcett.
SELECT *
FROM actor_info
WHERE first_name = 'Bob' AND last_name = 'Fawcett';

7. Use a Stored Procedure to get the 4 inventory ids for the film "Alien Center" at Store #2. 
SELECT film_id
FROM  film
WHERE title = 'Alien Center';
CALL film_in_stock(15,2,@count_out);

8. Insert a new store. Ensure that you use TRANSACTION. (This one is possible but it's tough! 
   Pay attention to constraints and the order that you are inserting data.) 
START TRANSACTION;
SAVEPOINT beforeInsert;
INSERT INTO staff(staff_id,first_name,last_name,address_id,picture,email,store_id,active,username,password)
VALUES(3,'John','Doe',5,NULL,'jd@sakila.com',2,1,'jdoe',NULL);

INSERT INTO store(store_id,manager_staff_id,address_id)
VALUES(3,3,3);

UPDATE staff
SET store_id = 3
WHERE staff_id = 3;

COMMIT;

9. Update the timestamp to the current date/time for the new store you entered in the previous question. 
UPDATE store
SET last_update = current_timestamp()
WHERE store_id = 3;


10. Delete the new store. 
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE staff
SET store_id = 2
WHERE staff_id = 3;

delete from store
where store_id = 3 LIMIT 1;

delete from staff
where staff_id = 3 LIMIT 1;

COMMIT;
